# Common Wears Research Activities Recap

## Overview
In this presentation, we will provide a comprehensive summary of our research activities conducted over recent months. Our focus has been on three primary areas:

### Learning Enhancement through AC Integration
Our efforts in learning enhancement have centered around the integration and application of Aggregate Computing (AC) in various learning processes. Key developments include:

- **AC in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Initiatives to expand the Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach in this domain.
- **AC for Federated Learning (FL)**: Utilization of AC as a dynamic platform for executing FL at the edge. This includes plans for its integration into the COORDINATION framework, exploring concepts such as gossip protocols and SCR.
- **ScaRLib Development**: Enhancement of the ManyRL library, ScaRLib, which now features improved system integration, comprehensive documentation, and extensive experimental support.

### Library/API Innovations for Bridging the Reality Gap
We have made significant strides in narrowing the reality gap through the introduction of novel abstractions that facilitate the development of AC-based applications. Notable advancements include:

- **MacroSwarm Enhancements**: Expansion of the MacroSwarm block, incorporating consensus algorithms and an improved evaluation process. This also includes the addition of documentation and an artefact on Maven. Future plans involve the utilization of different simulators for programming these blocks.
- **FRASP**: This is an extension of Aggregate Computing focused on reactive programming. It's crucial to understand its significance in the realm of common wears. Efforts are underway to evaluate it through temporal logic and extend the API.
- **Visual ScaFi**: Aiming to simplify AC usage, we propose a new Domain-Specific Language (DSL) utilizing Blockly for a visual programming paradigm. This is programmed for the COORDINATION project.

### Exploratory Projects
Our exploratory work involves:

- **RuFi**: A minimal core of AC developed in Rust, aimed at becoming a new lingua franca for AC. This includes:
  - Development of a minimal core that encompasses just the essential mechanisms.
  - Ensuring compatibility with common-wears, allowing potential deployment on various platforms.
  - Currently in the early stages, with several thesis projects and research initiatives underway.
